      <h3>We explain “how cryptocurrency works.” The goal of this guide is to teach beginners about blockchain and
        digital currencies (like Bitcoin).</h3>
      <p>
        Cryptocurrency is roughly the equivalent of using PayPal or a Debit Card, except the numbers on the screen
        represent cryptocurrency instead of dollars. All a new user needs to do is set up a Coinbase account or download
        the Cash App to get started. With Coinbase users can buy, sell, send, receive, and store Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash,
        Ether, and Litecoin (Coinbase provides an all-in-one wallet, broker, and exchange service making them a
        one-stop-shop for new users). With Cash App users can buy, sell, send, receive, and store Bitcoin.

            <p>1998 – 2009 The pre-Bitcoin years.</p>
          </b>

          <p>Although Bitcoin was the first established cryptocurrency, there had been previous attempts at creating
            online
            currencies with ledgers secured by encryption. Two examples of these were B-Money and Bit Gold, which were
            formulated but never fully developed.

              2008 – The Mysterious Mr Nakamoto.</p>
          </b>

          <p> A paper called Bitcoin – A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System was posted to a mailing list discussion on
            cryptography. It was posted by someone calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto, whose real identity remains a
            mystery to this day.

              2009 – Bitcoin begins.</p>
          </b>

          <p>The Bitcoin software is made available to the public for the first time and mining – the process through
            which
            new Bitcoins are created and transactions are recorded and verified on the blockchain – begins.

              2010 – Bitcoin is valued for the first time.</p>
          </b>

          <p>As it had never been traded, only mined, it was impossible to assign a monetary value to the units of the
            emerging cryptocurrency. In 2010, someone decided to sell theirs for the first time – swapping 10,000 of
            them
            for two pizzas. If the buyer had hung onto those Bitcoins, at today’s prices they would be worth more than
            $100
            million.

              2011 – Rival cryptocurrencies emerge.</p>
          </b>

          <p>As Bitcoin increases in popularity and the idea of decentralized and encrypted currencies catch on, the
            first
            alternative cryptocurrencies appear. These are sometimes known as altcoin and generally try to improve on
            the
            original Bitcoin design by offering greater speed, anonymity or some other advantage. Among the first to
            emerge
            were Namecoin and Litecoin. Currently there are over 1,000 cryptocurrencies in circulation with new ones
            frequently appearing.

              2013 – Bitcoin price crashes.</p>

          <p>Shortly after the price of one Bitcoin reaches $1,000 for the first time, the price quickly begins to
            decline.
            Many who invested money at this point will have suffered losses as the price plummeted to around $300 – it
            would
            be more than two years before it reached $1,000 again.

              2014 – Scams and theft</p>
          </b>

          <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly for a currency designed with anonymity and lack of control in mind, Bitcoin has
            proven
            to
            be an attractive and lucrative target for criminals. In January 2014, the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange
            Mt.Gox went offline, and the owners of 850,000Bitcoins never saw them again. Investigations are still trying
            to
            get to the bottom of exactly what happened but whatever the story, someone dishonestly got their hands on a
            haul
            which at the time was valued at $450 million dollars. At today’s prices, those missing coins would be worth
            $4.4
            billion.

              2016 – Ethereum and ICOs.</p>
          </b>

          <p>One cryptocurrency came close to stealing Bitcoin’s thunder this year, as enthusiasm grew around the
            Ethereum
            platform. This platform uses cryptocurrency known as Ether to facilitate blockchain-based smart contracts
            and
            apps. Ethereum’s arrival was marked by the emergence of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). These are fundraising
            platforms which offer investors the chance to trade what are often essentially stocks or shares in startup
            ventures, in the same manner that they can invest and trade cryptocurrencies. In the US the SEC warned
            investors
            that due to the lack of oversight ICOs could easily be scams or ponzi schemes disguised as legitimate
            investments. The Chinese government went one further, by banning them outright.

              2017 –Bitcoin reaches $10,000 and continues to grow</p>
          </b>

          <p>A gradual increase in the places where Bitcoin could be spent contributed to its continued growth in
            popularity,
            during a period where it’s value remained below previous peaks. Gradually as more and more uses emerged, it
            became clear that more money was flowing into the Bitcoin and cryptocoin ecosystem. During this period the
            market cap of all cryptocoins rose from $11bn to its current height of over $300bn. Banks including
            Barclays,
            Citi Bank, Deutsche Bankand BNP Paribas have said they are investigating ways they might be able to work
            with
            Bitcoin. Meanwhile the technology behind Bitcoin – blockchain – has sparked a revolution in the fintech
            industry
            (and beyond) which is only just getting started.
